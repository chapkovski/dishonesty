    <p>
        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this study, one of you will be the Sender and the other
        Participant is the Receiver. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
        which will be randomly assigned.
    </p>

    <p>
    {{ allocation1 }} is the amount of allocation of shared endowment with
    {{ Constants.players_per_group }} players per group,
    an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }},
    and an efficiency factor of {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the Sender, you will be given {{ Constants.endowment }} to split with the other participant. The Sender will
        decide how much she or he will retain. Each of endowment share retrieved by the sender will be multiplied by {{Constants.multiplier}}. Then the rest will go to
        Participant 2. The tabel below exhibit the relative benefit to the Sender and the Receiver in each possible allocation chosen by the sender
