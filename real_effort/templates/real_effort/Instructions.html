        At the begining of our session all participants are invited to participate in
        a production phase where you will find a paragraph in a hard copy format and on screen. You are requested to transcribe it into an input box in their computer screen; you will have 5 minutes to finish the work.  For every word they type correctly on the screen,
        the participant receives a lab token reward with the value AUD$ 0.05 after completing this task, the token is automatically added to participant’s wallet and subsequently referred in the task as participant endowment.
