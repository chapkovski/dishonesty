       Second Task Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Thank you for completing your trial phase for the second task.
        Now you will start the first round of the Second Task, You are paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. One of you will assume
        the role to be the sender and the other participant will assume the role to be the receiver.

    <p>
       Both the sender and the receiver will share {{ Constants.endowment }} lab token. The Sender will decide how much she or he
       will retain. Then the rest will go to the receiver. This task is going to be repeated several times with variation in
       the amount of shared endowment and relative benefit of players. Prior to making a decision, our algorithm will generate
       a number that determines the proportion of your endowment share. This information is only observed by the sender.
