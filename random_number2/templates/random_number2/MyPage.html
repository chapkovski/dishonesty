<p>
     <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">
        {{ randnumber2 }}
    </h3> is a number randomly generated by our algorithm. This information is only accesible to you as the Sender.
    Your co-player will never observe or exposed to this information. This random number is your basis of allocating your shared endowment with
    {{ Constants.players_per_group }} players per group,
    with an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }}, you should allocate {{ randnumber2 }} multiplied by an multiplicative factor of {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
    therefore you should allocate <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">{{allocation2}} </h3> to your co-player
