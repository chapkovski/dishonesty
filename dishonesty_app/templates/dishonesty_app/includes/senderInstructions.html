        As <strong> the Sender </strong>, you will have to split {{ Constants.endowment }} with the other participant.
        You will be the one to
        decide how much she or he will retain. In this session, each of endowment share retrieved by the sender will be
        multiplied by {{ Constants.rand_multiplier }}. Then the rest will go to
        the receiver.
        {% if subsession.is_bonus_treatment %}
            The receiver, however, will receive additional {{ subsession.bonus }} irrespective the proportion of
            endowment
            allocated by the receiver.
