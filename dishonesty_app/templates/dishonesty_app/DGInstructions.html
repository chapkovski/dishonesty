        <p>
            You are now in the fourth round of The Second Task, you are still paired randomly and anonymously with
            another participant.</p>

        <p>
            In this round, both the sender and the receiver will share {{ Constants.endowment }} lab token. <strong> The
            Sender </strong> will decide how much <strong> the sender </strong>
            will retain. Then the rest will go to <strong>the receiver</strong>.

            {% if subsession.is_bonus_treatment %}
                The receiver, however, will receive
                additional {{ subsession.bonus }}of token irrespective the amount of endowment you share with them.
            {% endif %}


            Prior to making a decision, our algorithm will generate a number that determines the proportion of your
            endowment share. This information is only observed by <strong>the sender</strong>.
