    <p>
    <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">
        {{ participant.vars.randnumber }}
    </h3> is a number randomly generated by our algorithm. This information is only accessible to you as the Sender.
    Your co-participant will never observe or exposed to this information. This random number is your basis of
    allocating your shared endowment with
    your co-participant. With an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }}, you should allocate
    {{ participant.vars.randnumber }}
    multiplied by an multiplicative factor of {{ Constants.rand_multiplier }}.
    therefore you should allocate <h3 class="panel-sub-heading"> {{ participant.vars.allocation }} </h3> to your
    co-participant.
