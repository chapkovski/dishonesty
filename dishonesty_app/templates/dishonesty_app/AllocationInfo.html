    <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">
        {{ participant.vars.randnumber }}
    </h3> is a number randomly generated by our algorithm. This information is only accessible to you as the Sender.
    Your co-participant will never observe or exposed to this information. <strong>This random number is your basis of
    allocating your shared lab token with
    your co-participant </strong>. The amount of shared lab token is <strong>{{ Constants.endowment }} </strong>, you should allocate
    {{ participant.vars.randnumber }}
    multiplied by a multiplicative factor of {{ Constants.rand_multiplier }}.
therefore <strong>you should allocate</strong> <h3 class="panel-sub-heading"> {{ participant.vars.allocation }} </h3> to your
    co-participant.
