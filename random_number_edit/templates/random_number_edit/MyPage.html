    Allocation of shared endowment
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

 <p> As the Sender, you will be given {{ Constants.endowment }} to split with the other participant. You are asked to share your endowment
     based on the following random number.
 </p>

<p>
     <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">
        {{ randnumber_edit }}
    </h3> is a number randomly generated by our algorithm. This information is only accessible to you as the sender.
    Your co-participant will never observe or exposed to this information. This random number is your basis of allocating your shared endowment with
    your co-participant. With a shared endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }}, you should allocate {{ randnumber_edit }} multiplied by an multiplicative factor of {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
    therefore you should allocate <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">{{allocation_edit}} </h3> to your co-participant.
