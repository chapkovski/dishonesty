        You are now paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. Our algorithm
        will generate a number that determines the proportion of your endowment share. Your co-player, <strong> the sender </strong> allocates the proportion of shared
        endowment and privately observes the random number displayed on their screen.
    </p>

    <p>
       You are <strong> the receiver. </strong>  </p>

    <p>
        You will receive a part of {{ Constants.endowment }} given by your co-player (the sender). The Sender will
       decide how much she or he will retain. Each of endowment share retrieved by the sender will be multiplied by {{Constants.multiplier}}.
       The tabel below exhibit the relative benefit enjoyed by the Sender and the receiver in each possible allocation chosen by the sender.

    As <strong> the receiver </strong>, we would like you to <strong> guess </strong> the amount of allocated endowment by
    your co-player given the random number indicates that {{allocation1}} is the amount of allocation of shared endowment with
    {{ Constants.players_per_group }}.

    Every correct guess will be rewarded 10 lab token to your wallet
