       Second Task Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this study, one of you will be the sender and the other
        participant is the receiver.

    <p>
       Both the sender and the receiver will share {{ Constants.endowment }} lab token. The Sender will decide how much she or he
       will retain. Then the rest will go to the receiver. This task is going to be repeated several times with variation in
       the amount of shared endowment and relative benefit of players. Prior to making a decision, our algorithm will generate
       a number that determines the proportion of your endowment share. This information is only observed by the sender.
