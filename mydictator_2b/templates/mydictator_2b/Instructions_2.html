    <p>
        In this round,  you are still paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. Our algorithm
        will generate a number that determines the proportion of your endowment share. Your co-player, <strong> the sender </strong> allocates the proportion of shared
        endowment and privately observes the random number displayed on their screen.
    </p>

    <p>
       You are <strong> the receiver. </strong>  </p>

    <p>
       In this round, you will again receive a part of {{ Constants.endowment }} given by your co-player (the sender). The Sender will
       decide how much she or he will retain. Each of endowment share retrieved by the sender will be multiplied by {{Constants.multiplier}}. As the receiver,
        You will receive the rest of the shared endowment with an addition of 40 points.
       The table below exhibits the relative benefit enjoyed by the Sender and the receiver in each possible allocation chosen by the sender.

    As <strong> the receiver </strong>, we would like you to <strong> guess </strong> the amount of allocated endowment by
    your co-participant given the different possible random number indicated by our algorithm

    Every correct guess will be rewarded 10 lab token to your wallet
