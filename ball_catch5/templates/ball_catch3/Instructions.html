    <p>
        In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. Both of you will make decisions in a series of tasks.
        Our activity today will consist of <strong> four phases. </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
         In the <strong>first phase </strong>, A group of players will participate in a production phase in which they will earn your individual
        endowment. Another group of players will receive a fix endowment without participating in the first phase. In the <strong>second phase </strong> (the allocation Phase), and in the <strong>third phase </strong>, (the box collection phase) you will be required to make a
        series of decision in a multiple rounds. Finally, the <strong>fourth</strong> phase is the survey phase; in which you have to answer all the questions.
    </p>

    <p>

        In each decision task, you can earn money. Our computer algorithm will keep track of how much money you earn throughout the session.
        Only after you answer all the questions and finish all study phases that you will receive your payments.

    </p>

    <p>
        We will start with the first phase of our experiment : <strong> The Production Phase </strong>. We will randomly select the participants eligible to this phase.
        If you are eligible, you will find the task appearing in your computer screen. Please proceed to the next page.
