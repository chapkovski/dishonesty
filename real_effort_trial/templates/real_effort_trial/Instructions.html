        At the beginning of our session, Most of our study participant are invited to participate in
        a production phase where you will find a paragraph in a hard copy format and on screen. You are requested to transcribe it into an input box in your computer screen; you will have 2 minutes to finish the task.  For every word that you type correctly in the input box,
        you will be rewarded with one lab token  with the value AUD$ 0.01. After completing this task, the token is automatically added to participant’s wallet and subsequently referred in the task as your endowment. We will begin with a trial page and continue with the first production task.
